This is a repository where you'll find Digital Micrograph and Python scripts that I have been making since the start of my PhD (around 2016) 
and I think that they can be useful to many people interested in electron microscopy and electron crystallography.

Almost everything is related to electron diffraction data, both acquisition-wise and data formating stuff, yet I believe that some electron
microscopist may find them useful (or not). Hope it helps!
