This is a repository where you'll find Digital Micrograph and Python scripts that I have been making since the start of my PhD (around 2016) and I think that they can be useful to many people interested in electron microscopy and electron crystallography. I have to say that most of my knowledge in Digital Micrograph scripting comes from the all-powerful website of Dave Mitchell (http://www.dmscripting.com/scripts.html) from where I got a lot of functions that back in time where not available to many places, so big thanks to his work!

Almost everything is related to electron diffraction data, both acquisition-wise and data formating stuff, yet I believe that some electronmicroscopist may find them useful (or not). Hope it helps!
