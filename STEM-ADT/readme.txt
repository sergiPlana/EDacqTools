This folder needs to be copied and pasted into a desired directory and the first lines of the main DM script have to be modified to point to this path.

This is an implementation fully optimized for a JEOL F200 with an IS Gatan camera (ideally OneView) and a DigiScan scanning system. 
It also takes into account that the PyJEM package from JEOL to control the microscope is installed and configured in the same PC of Digital Micrograph.
